- [x] Prometheus metrics collection and alerting.
- [x] Grafana dashboards and visualization.
- [x] Redis caching (session data, metrics, user preferences).
- [x] Performance optimization (CDN, compression, lazy loading).
- [x] Load testing and performance benchmarks.
- [x] Error tracking and monitoring (Sentry integration).

## Phase M5 — Security & Testing (Week 6) ✅ COMPLETED

**Phase Summary**: Implemented comprehensive security measures and testing infrastructure:
- Security service with rate limiting, CORS, CSRF protection, content security policy, and input validation
- Consent service for GDPR compliance with consent management, retention policies, and data deletion
- Comprehensive security testing covering authentication bypass, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, file upload security, rate limiting, input validation, session security, API key validation, CSP, HTTPS enforcement, data exposure prevention, privilege escalation, and logout security
- Chaos engineering tests for GPU failures, S3 storage failures, database connection failures, NATS broker failures, Redis cache failures, worker service failures, network partitions, memory leaks, graceful degradation, and data consistency
- Load testing scenarios for concurrent users, high-frequency API requests, large file uploads, concurrent file processing, WebSocket stress, database performance, memory usage, CPU usage, network bandwidth, and concurrent user interactions

- [x] Rate limits; CORS/CSRF; content security policy.
- [x] Consent & retention flows; deletion endpoints; audit trail.
